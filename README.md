# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

QUICK FORWARD:

This project was by far my most difficult to date, I will admit, some functionality that was asked for is not present.  Currently, the highscores tables does not work, apologies.  Even though the project is incomplete I do feel a sense of accomplishment over this one, I really tried to solve the problems on my own (mostly) instead of looking for easy answers on the internet.

ACTUAL DESCRIPTION:
This project is a simple JavaScript quiz containing 5 timed questions.  You will have 75 seconds to answer all questions, incorrect answers will subtract 10 seconds from your total time.  The end score is a result of your time left, not correct/incorrect questions answered.  The quiz will inform you of right and wrong answers.  My hope is to implement the highscores function at a later date and resubmit the project, unless I've already fixed that by the time you are reading this and in that case :)!
